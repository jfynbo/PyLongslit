--------------
Hardcoded nframes in mkspecbias.py and mkspecflat.py made dynamic
by automatic determination based on the number of files in the list.

reducescience.py and reducestd.py made into one script,
here all input/output made dynamic so the scripts no longer
depend on pre-determined number of files. This edit allows
for cosmic ray removal for standard stars also.

--------------
Changed reduceobs.py to be called by wrapper scripts reducescience.py 
and reducestd.py . Same for extract_1d.py, now also called by wrapper 
scripts extract_science_1d.py and extract_std_1d.py.

standard.py made more user friendly ("animated masking and simpler commands").
