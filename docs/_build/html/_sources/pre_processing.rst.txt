Bias
""""

The `mkspecbias.py` is to be called from the `rawbias` directory.
In the directory, a list of all paths to the bias frames needs
to be provided, and it should be called `specbias.list` . Inside
the `mkspecbias.py` script, the `ysize` anx `xsize` parameters
need to be set manually.

Before excecuting, the contents of the `rawbias` directory
should look like this: 

.. code-block:: bash

    ├── mkspecbias.py
    └── specbias.list

Now, while in the `rawbias` directory, excecute:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 mkspecbias.py 

This should produce a master bias frame, and the result will be
saved in the `rawbias` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    ├── BIAS.fits
    ├── mkspecbias.py
    └── specbias.list

Flats
"""""

The `mkspecflat.py` is to be called from the `rawflats` directory.
In the directory, a list of all paths to the flat frames needs
to be provided, and it should be called `specflat.list` . Inside
the `mkspecflat.py` script, the `ysize` anx `xsize` parameters
need to be set manually. The script also uses the previously 
produced master bias frame (do **not** move it from the  `rawbias` directory).

Before excecuting, the contents of the `rawflats` directory
should look like this: 

.. code-block:: bash

    ├── mkspecflat.py
    └── specflat.list

Now, while in the `rawflats` directory, excecute:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 mkspecflat.py

This should produce a master flat frame, and the result will be
saved in the `rawflats` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    ├── Flat.fits
    ├── mkspecflat.py
    └── specflat.list

Cosmic ray removal and 1d-extraction
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The pre-processing of the science and standard star frames is done almost
identically for both, and will therefore be described together. **This procedure
also reduces the arc-lamp frames, which are used for wavelength calibration.**

This is to be done after the bias and flat frames have been produced.

Two directories are used for this step, `rawscience` and `rawstd`.
In both directories, a list of all paths to the science/standard star frames needs
to be provided, and it should be called `raw_science.list` and `raw_std.list` respectively.
Also, in both directories, a list of all paths to the arc frames needs
to be provided. This is the same for both directories, and it should be called `raw_arcs.list` .
The `crremoval.py` script is used to remove cosmic rays from the frames, 
and the `reducescience.py` and `reducestd.py` scripts are used to extract the 1d-spectra.
The `reducescience.py` and `reducestd.py` rely on the `reduceobs.py` script, 
which is used to placed in the parenting directory. The whole structure should 
look like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    ├── rawscience
    │   ├── crremoval.py
    │   ├── raw_arcs.list
    │   ├── raw_science.list
    │   └── reducescience.py
    ├── rawstd
    │   ├── crremoval.py
    │   ├── raw_arcs.list
    │   ├── raw_std.list
    │   └── reducestd.py
    ├── reduceobs.py

In the `crremoval.py` scripts, you will need to set the 
`gain` and `ron (RDNOISE)` parameters - these can be aquired 
from the header of the frames. Several paramters can also
be set for guiding the `astroscrappy.detect_cosmics <https://astroscrappy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/astroscrappy.detect_cosmics.html>`_
method.

In the `reducescience.py` and `reducestd.py` scripts, you will need to set the
`ysize` and `xsize` parameters, and also provide a list of the x-coordinate 
centers of the objects. If there are several frames, make sure the centers
are provided to match the frames in alphabetical order. In order to find the centers,
open the observations with your preferred `.fits` image viewer, and read of the x-coordinates
of the object centers manually.


Now, while in the `rawscience` directory, excecute:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 crremoval.py

, and then:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 reducescience.py

Similary, while in the `rawstd` directory, excecute:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 crremoval.py

, and then:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 reducestd.py

Several files should be produced:

.. code-block:: bash

    ├── arcsub.fits
    ├── arcsub_std.fits
    ├── obj.fits
    ├── rawscience
    │   ├── crrALDh120177.fits
    │   ├── crrALDh120178.fits
    │   ├── crremoval.py
    │   ├── raw_arcs.list
    │   ├── raw_science.list
    │   ├── reducescience.py
    │   ├── sub1.fits
    │   └── sub2.fits
    ├── rawstd
    │   ├── crrALDh120217.fits
    │   ├── crremoval.py
    │   ├── raw_arcs.list
    │   ├── raw_std.list
    │   ├── reducestd.py
    │   └── sub1.fits
    ├── reduceobs.py
    └── std.fits

.. note::
    You might see a directory `__pycache__` being created in the 
    different directories at this point and in further steps. 
    Simply ignore these.

The files starting with `crr` and `sub` are in-between products and have 
no importance for further processing. The `arcsub.fits` and `arcsub_std.fits`
are reduced arc-lamp frames, and the `obj.fits` and `std.fits` are the extracted
1d-spectra of the science and standard star frames respectively. **These 4
are the files that will be used for further processing.**

but it is provided for those who are interested or might consider
developing the software.
