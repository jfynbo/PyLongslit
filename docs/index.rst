Welcome to PyLongslit's documentation!
======================================


PyLongslit is simple Python software for reduction of astronomical long-slit spectra.
As for now, the software is tested and designed to work with data from 
`ALFOSC <https://www.not.iac.es/instruments/alfosc/>`_ at the
Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT), but adaptions to other instruments should be 
possible - feel free to fork the repository and make your own changes.

The software is based on Johan Fynbo's `PyLongslit <https://github.com/jfynbo/PyLongslit>`_ 
and Kasper Heintz's `PyReduc <https://github.com/keheintz/PyReduc>`_.


PyLongslit is a work in progress, and the execution of the software is highly
manual. We provide a `notebook-friendly version of the software <https://github.com/KostasValeckas/PyLongslit_notebook>`_
for users who prefer to work in Jupyter notebooks. Please note that the notebook
version and the original version of the software are not identical, and they 
come with their own unique scripts.

In this documentation, we provide guidance on installation and a tutorial
that will guide you through a reduction of a long-slit spectrum.
