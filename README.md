# PyLongslit

PyLongslit is simple Python software for reduction of astronomical long-slit spectra.
As for now, the software is tested and designed to work with data from 
[ALFOSC](https://www.not.iac.es/instruments/alfosc/) at the
Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT), but adaptions to other instruments should be 
possible - feel free to fork the repository and make your own changes.

Installation, tutorials and other docs can be found at:

A notebook-friendly version can be found [here](https://github.com/KostasValeckas/PyLongslit_notebook).

The software is based on Johan Fynbo's [PyLongslit](https://github.com/jfynbo/PyLongslit) and Kasper Heintz's [PyReduc](https://github.com/keheintz/PyReduc).
